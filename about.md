In a world filled with contraption, gadgets, and gizmos. One being stands to conquer them all. That being, is Acid Density. Gaining self awareness in a swarm of sentient nanobots, Acid quickly learned the way of the swarm and disassembled every electronic device he could get his eager manipulators on. After a tragic accident involving a worm-hole and the clashing of two parallel dimensions, Acid found his consciousness had been transferred into the body of a human male. Attempts are still being made to transfer his consciousness into a less fragile container so that some day the technology may be created to send Acid back to the proper dimensional plane of existence.
